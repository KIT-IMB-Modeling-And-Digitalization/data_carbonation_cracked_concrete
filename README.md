# Dataset of the Article "Comparative analysis of engineering carbonation model extensions to account for pre-existing cracks"

The database `database_carbonation_cracked_concrete.CSV` contains data used to evaluate different carbonation models for cracked concrete in the article [Comparative analysis of engineering carbonation model extensions to account for pre-existing crack]().

The literature data was collected from various articles partially using a [PlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/).
In this repository the database is reported as:

| Category           | Description|
|----------------|--------------|
| Ref            |   reference ID |
| Mix type       | concrete/ mortar/ paste |
| binder type    | OPC / Fa+OPC |
| crack type     | notch / natural /no crack |
| w/b [-]        | water-binder ratio |
| exposure time [year] | exposure time to $CO_2$ |
| crack width [mm] | crack width at the surface |
| crack depth [mm] | crack depth |
| carbonation depth [mm] | Measured carbonation depth. For crack width=0 and crack depth=0 it is the carbonation depth of the uncreacked conecrete. Otherwise it is the maximum carbonation depth at the location of a crack. |
| CO2 [%]        | $CO_2$ concentration of the experiment |
| RH [%]         | relative humidity of the experiment |
| DOI            | DOI link |
